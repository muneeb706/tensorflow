# TensorFlow Sample Programs
This repository contains Sample Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models built using TensorFlow.

# How to run

- Download latest stable version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
- Install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- Run the desired file from python command e-g If you want to run neural_network.py file then you will type following command (assuming you are in the same directory where file is placed).
    ```bash    
    python neural_network.py
    ```
- Script will generate logs in logs folder and saved model for deployment. If you want to visualize logs in tensorboard then you need to type following command.
    ```bash    
    tensorboard --logdir=[path to logs directory]
    ```
  It will print the url. You need to open the url in browser to view tensorboard.
