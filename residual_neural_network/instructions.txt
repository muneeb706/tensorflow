It contains example of the use of the residual neural network for image recognition. 
Use of High Performance Computing Clusters are recommended to use this program.

The dataset is CIFAR 10. 

if you can not download the dataset on your own then 
Run the following Python code on your machine to cifar10 dataset:

    python generate_cifar10_tfrecords.py --data-dir=${PWD}/cifar-10-data

    and use ${PWD}/cifar-10-data to run cifar10_main.py:
  
    python cifar10_main.py --data-dir=${PWD}/cifar-10-data \
                         --job-dir=${PWD}/output \
                         --num-gpus=1 \
                         --train-steps=1000
